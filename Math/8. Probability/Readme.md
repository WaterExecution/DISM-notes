# Rule of Addition
```
P(A∪B) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A∩B)
```
# Rule of Complementary Events
```
P(A’) + P(A) = 1
```
# Disjoint Events
```
P(A∩B) = 0
```
# Independent Events
```
P(A∩B) = P(A) ⋅ P(B)
```
# Conditional Probability
```
P(A | B) = P(A∩B) / P(B)
```
# Bayes Formula
```
P(A | B) = P(B | A) ⋅ P(A) / P(B)
```
