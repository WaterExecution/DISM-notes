# Data
```
Data is stored as binary digits
```

# Unit
```
8 bits = 1 byte
4 bytes = 1 word
32 bits = 1 word
```

# Cache memory
```
Smaller and faster than main memory(RAM)
3 Levels, Level 1 fastest
```

# Processor
```
ALU Logic circuits - perform arithmetic and logic operations
Timing and control circuits - fetch instructions and data
Registers - each hold one word of data
```

# Computer
```
Information > Input > Memory > ALU > Control Unit > Output
```

# Instruction Cycle
```
Fetch - get instruction and increment program counter
Decode - decode instruction
Execute - ALU
Store - write/read to register
//Write to destination register
```

# Instruction Types
```
Load - Read data from memory/input into processor
Store - Write data from processor into memory/output
Operate - Arithemetic/Logic in registers
```

# Processor components
```
Program counter - memory address of current instruction
Instruction register - current instruction
(EIP/RIP) -> 0x12345678(Location) -> 0xDEADFFFF(Instruction)

General-purpose registers - hold data and addresses
(EAX/RAX, EBX,RBX)

ALU/Control Unit
(XOR EAX, 4) -> XOR gate
```

# Performance
```
Speed of electrionic circuits (Hz)
Access time of cache and RAM
Design of instruction set (Logical gates)
Number of cores
```
