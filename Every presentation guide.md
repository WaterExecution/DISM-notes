How to start a talk.

1. Never start with a joke, it always falls flat.
2. Start with an empowerment statement, i.e. what will the audience achieve after the talk.
3. Humans have only one language processor, so make sure they focus on what you're saying.

Sample Heuristics:

1. Cycle on the topic. Repeat what are talking about to reinforce it
2. Build a fence around your ideas, so audiences don't confuse them with the ideas from others. Tell them how your idea is different from others.
3. Use verbal punctuation to help audiences re-focus. State what you have covered so far and what is there to come.
4. Ask questions. Engage the audience with moderately difficult questions every now and then. But not very difficult ones.

Place and Time

1. Best time for having a lecture is 11 am.
 (not too early and not after lunch)
2. The place should be well lit.
3. The place should be seen and checked before the lecture.
4. The place should not be full less than a half, it must be chosen according to the amount of listeners.

Tools
For teaching.
1. Board – it’s got graphics, speed, target. Watch your hands! Don’t hold them behind your back, it’s better to keep them straight and use for pointing at the board. 
2. Props – use them in order to make your ideas visual. Visual perception is the most effective way to interact with listeners.
3. Don’t put too many words on a slide. Slides should just reflect what you’re saying, not the other way around. Pictures attracts attention and people start to wait for your explanation – use that tip. (FONT 40)
4. Make slide as easy as you can – no title, no distracting pictures, frames, points and so on.
5. Do not use laser pointer – due to that you lose eye contact with the audience. Instead you can make the arrows just upon a slide. 

Informing
 
Show to your listeners your stuff is cool and interesting.
You have to be able to:
-show your vision of that problem
-show that you’ve done particular things (by steps)
All of that should be done real quick in no more than 5 min.
Persuade your listeners you’re not a rookie (Prof. Winston contrived to do that from the very first seconds of his talk)

Getting Famous
If you want to your ideas be remembered you’ve got to have
 "5 S"


- Symbols associate with your ideas (visual perception is the best way to attract attention)
- Slogan (describing your idea)
- Surprise (common fallacy that is no longer true, for instance, just after you’ve told about it)
- Salient Idea (not necessarily important but the one that sticks out)
- Story (how you did it, how it works…)

How to End

- Don’t put collaborators at the end, do that at the beginning.
- Question’s the worst way to end a talk.
- It’s good to end with a Contribution slide – to sum up everything you’ve told with your OWN decision.
- At the very end you could tell a joke since people then will leave the event feeling fun and thus keep a good memory of your talk.
- "Thank you (for listening)" isn’t good ending, it’s trite at least. You can end with a quote of a prominent person (my own knowledge), with a salute to people (how much you valued the time being here, the people over here..., “I’d like to get back, it was fun!”
